# A blog eat blog kind of world

It seems to be the on trend thing to do (second only to starting a podcast... which I'm not ruling out). But I've started this here blog.

If you dig around this site you'll see an old wiki for my time as a R&D pipeline TD in the animation and vfx industry (heavily inspired by Matt Estela from cgwiki). Weirdly I've been inspired to start this blog via another Matt... Matt Web from https://interconnected.org.

Matt Webb, very kindly, has a public link on his site to book a catchup. His post ["Context plumbing"](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/11/28/plumbing) was the one that pushed me over the edge to reach out. An interesting read that resonated with ideas I've explored around Magpai. Matt's a great guy. Definitely read his blog!

But why a blog?

Mostly cause I'm lazy, partly cause running a startup is lonely. 

I've never quite felt like I had anything valuable to say - and while I still think that's the case - more and more I feel that human experiences are even more valuable in today's agentic world. 

So here we are. 

Read it, don't read it. I don't mind.

If you're in Sydney - [hit me up](mailto:ben@magpai.app) and I'll buy you a coffee.

I too might add a meeting booking link, but I think for now, probably not enough people care.
