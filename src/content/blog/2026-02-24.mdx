# Tabs as nodes

I have a toxic love of nodes. I think a lot of people are probably used to the nodes of n8n or make. But my first node-love was [houdini](houdini.com).

A tool now used by most of the VFX and Animation industry, Houdini still feels like magic to me, and there's probably 3/5 days a week where it crosses my mind.

Instead of going to nodes anonymous, I beat my head into the wall of trying to get others to use them.

Today's node flavour? Browser tabs, as nodes.

With the heavy help of claude and codex, I've been experimenting with viewing and controlling websites with agentic ai. 

It's best viewed as a video, so have at it.

[It's open source](https://github.com/Vochsel/hoo), there should be windows and mac builds with BYO API keys.

Let me know if you like it!
