# The FileMakerPro of the AI wave

FileMaker Pro is a pretty niche piece of kit. It's kinda like excel with a UI builder. I think.

I can't claim to have much experience building in it. My father's signage business used a very specific template built on top of it (KiM). And I've fiddled around with it on several occasions. They gated editing most of the functionality behind a pricey dev license.

I've recently been working on building my dad a custom signage job management tool. Familiar enough to use, helpful enough to reduce ~12 hours a week of painful clicking around, and all code I can edit for free. (Huge shoutout to this FileMaker Pro -> SQL converter by Evan Miller)

It definitely was a pretty widely used tool, I think it's ability to be customized and templated helped, along with a big market of builders.

So what is the fancy, shiny AI equivalent?

I guess the answer pre-AI is Airtable, perhaps even post-AI... They (like many other incumbents) are fighting the fair fight to maintain relevance.

I recently wrote a LinkedIn post about self-evolving saas, and I think my thoughts here overlap.

The current narrative is very much:

- AI can write software
- Most Saas is just a wrapper on a database
- Therefore, saas is dead

Saas dying is fairly hyperbolic, but i do think there is some truth to the stock sell off.

The two common rebuttals are

- "Someone still needs to prompt it because domain experts won't have the time to build it even if its 3 prompts", and
- "Humans need familiar ui's, they won't want an AI generated UI, changing every day"

Point 2 is not really relevant, as code will be the persistent piece here.

Point 1 is true right now, but I've been asked by 3 different small businesses that have vibe coded their own \{Insert boutique saas tool or agent here\}.

Their desire to monetise these vibe coded tools seem ill-placed (and a huge distraction imo). However the team was capable enough (all founders interestingly), and had the time to build a very specific tool for their business. And the tools are currently providing actual internal value.

So perhaps its the vibe coding tools? Perhaps its claude code? Perhaps agencies and hr consultants and event signage people will hire part time "AI Builders" to help run their boutique software?

That doesn't seem like a familiar answer, but it does feel like there's a gap for a new platform play here...
